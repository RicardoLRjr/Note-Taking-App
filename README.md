 ## Installation Instructions:
 It is plug and play! Just pop it and the included files with it in a directory, run a npm install and it will work automatically. 

 ## Usage Instructions:
 To look at the notes, click the get started page on the homepage, and then enter your note title and the notes themselves in the provided boxes! Once you've entered your note, click on the floppy disc and it will be saved to the db.json. To delete, click on the pencil icon next to the floppy disc. To handle these requests, a series of API calls are used to provide this functionality.
